							<p class="small-left"> <h1> FoodChain Privacy Policy </h1></p>
							<p> Thank you for using Foodchain! This policy is to help you, the user, understand what information
we collect and store, and what is done with your data. Due to the nature of our company, these
terms are to be easily understood and clear as to our intentions, and show our dedication to
you, the users.
</br></br>
What information does Foodchain collect?
</br></br>
1. FoodChain collects data that you, the user, have entered willingly into our application.
</br></br>
When you sign up for or use FoodChain, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can
include your name, profile photo, comments, upvotes,
downvotes,
tryit's,
avoidit's,
the email
address you used to sign up, location data, and any other information you provide us.
</br></br>
You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you
may link your Facebook or Twitter account to FoodChain, which allows us to obtain information
from those accounts (ex. friends, contacts, etc). The information we get from other applications
often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
This information is not shared or sold to third party sources. This information is for user
connectivity only, within the FoodChain application itself.
</br></br>
2. Technical Information about what device you are using, performance data, and common log
data.
</br></br>
These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other internet service, there’s
certain information that is created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use
FoodChain. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
</br></br>
Log data. When you use FoodChain, our servers automatically record information, including
information that your browser or mobile application sends when you’re using it. This log data
may include your Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, the date and time of
your requests, how you used FoodChain, and cookie data.
</br></br>
Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device
you’re using FoodChain on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re
using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all
of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For
example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac
or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device
makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software
provider.
</br></br>
How do we use the information we collect?
</br></br>
We use the information we collect to provide our product to you and make it better, develop new
products, and protect FoodChain and you, our users.
</br></br>
We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content, including but not limited
to:
</br></br>
Notifications, suggested profiles to follow, promoted posts, contestants, contest winners, etc.
</br></br>
What choices do you have about your information?
</br></br>
Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a
FoodChain account, many of the choices you have on FoodChain are built directly into the
product or your account settings. For example, you can: access and change information in your
profile page at any time, choose whether or not to follow or unfollow any account at any time,
edit your content, etc..
</br></br>
Cancel your account at any time. When you cancel your account, we'll deactivate it and remove
your posts, comments, votes, and other pertinent data from FoodChain. We may retain archived
copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to
help address cyber crimes, spam, or any criminal activity).
</br></br>
You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access
FoodChain. For example: The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control
cookies or other types of local data storage.
</br></br>
Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other
data is shared with us. To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided
by the device or software provider.
</br></br>
How and when do we share information?
</br></br>
FoodChain is a tool people use to search, share, critique, and find food. When you post
a plate, anyone can view them. You may also provide us with profile page information that
anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information
include:
</br></br>
When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services
(like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your FoodChain account to those
services or publish your activity on FoodChain to them.
</br></br>
If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, FoodChain shall by
regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or
FoodChain; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,
comply with all such requests as legally bound there to.
</br></br>
We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar
transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.
We may also share aggregated or nonpersonal
identifiable information with our partners,
advertisers, or others. For example, we may tell an advertiser on FoodChain how many people
reposted something they shared, or the percentage of people who voted and what number of
votes.
</br></br>
Our policy on children’s information.
</br></br>
FoodChain is not directed to children or persons under age 13. If you learn that your minor
child has provided us with personal information without your consent, or is unlawfully using
FoodChain, please contact us.
</br></br>
How do we make changes to this policy?
</br></br>
We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page.
If you continue to use FoodChain after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised
policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or get your consent
as required by law.
